# Automated Model selection

A package called glmulti offers a better approach, but leaps has a simpler interface, so weâ€™ll use leaps to learn the techniques.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(leaps)
library(CodeClanData)
```

```{r}
insurance %>%  view
```

```{r}
regsubsets_forward <- regsubsets(charges ~ ., data = insurance, nvmax = 8, method = "forward")
```


```{r}
plot(regsubsets_forward, scale = "adjr2")
```


```{r}
plot(regsubsets_forward, scale = "bic")
```



### Backward selection

```{r}
regsubsets_backward <- regsubsets(charges ~ ., data = insurance, nvmax = 8, method = "backward")
```

```{r}
plot(regsubsets_backward, scale = "adjr2")
```

### Exhaustive selection
```{r}
regsubsets_exhaustive <- regsubsets(charges ~ ., data = insurance, nvmax = 8, method = "exhaustive")
```

```{r}
plot(regsubsets_exhaustive, scale = "adjr2")
```


```{r}
model_without_region <- lm(charges ~ age + bmi + children + smoker, data = insurance)

summary(model_without_region)
```

```{r}
model_with_region <- lm(charges ~ age + bmi + children + smoker + region, data = insurance)

summary(model_with_region)
```

```{r}
anova(model_without_region, model_with_region)
```


```{r}
plot(model_without_region)
```
